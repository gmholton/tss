# Tone
		
Tanacross has a rich and complex tone system in which each syllable carries a relatively higher or lower pitch. High and low pitches can combine on a syllable to produce falling (high to low) and rising (low to high) tones. Additionally,  an "extra high" tone is used when negating a statement.			

Overlaid on the tone system is an <span class="def">intonation</span> system which differentiates different types of sentences (statements, questions, commands, etc.) based on patterns of pitch variation. For example, yes/no questions have a rise in  pitch at the end, while content questions fall in pitch at the end.			


The <span class="def">tone pattern</span> -- the sequence of tones on each syllable of each word -- is crucial to proper Tanacross pronunciation. There are many examples of tones and tone patterns throughout *The Sounds of Tanacross*. The sentences below were chosen specifically to illustrate contrasts between different tone patterns.

These examples serve to illustrate the richness of the tone system in Tanacross.

It should be noted that the 
<i>Tanacross Sound System</I> and other learning materials use tone marking to aid in learning to pronounce Tanacross words correctly. Fluent speakers will have no trouble producing the correct tone without the aid of any tone marking. It is thus perfectly possible and acceptable to write Tanacross without the tone marks.
