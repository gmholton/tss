<h1>Technical Notes -- Consonants</h1>
<h2>place and manner </h2>
<p>Consonants are produced with an obstruction to the airflow. Consonants can be classified according to the place and manner of this obstruction. </p>
<h3>Terms referring to place</h3>
<ul>
  <li>labial -- with the lips</li>
  <li>alveolar -- with the tongue on the ridge behind the fronth teeth; note that the affricate sounds begin at the alveolar place and the transition to another place</li>
  <li>dental -- with the tongue teeth behind the upper teeth or between the teeth</li>
  <li>lateral -- with the the tongue pressed against the ridge behind the teeth, but allowing air to flow around the sides of the tongue</li>
  <li>palatal -- with the tongue against the roof of the mouth</li>
  <li>velar -- with the back of the tongue pressed toward the back of mouth</li>
  <li>glottal -- at the glottis, or vocal folds </li>
</ul>
<h3>Terms referring to manner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>stop -- completely obstructing the airflow</li>
  <li>affricate -- a combination of a stop with a fricative</li>
  <li>fricative -- allowing air to flow roughly, with much friction noise</li>
  <li>sonorants -- allowing air to flow most freely, almost like a vowel</li>
  <li>voiced -- with the vocal folds vibrating</li>
  <li>voiceless -- without the vocal folds vibrating</li>
</ul>
