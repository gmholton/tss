		<h1>Technical Notes -- Ejectives </h1>
		<p>Tanacross contains six consonants which are written with an apostrophe in the practical orthography: &lt;tth'&gt;, &lt;t'&gt;, &lt;ts'&gt;, &lt;tl'&gt;, &lt;ch'&gt;, &lt;k'&gt;. These are the so-called <span class="def">glottalized</span> or <span class="def">ejective</span> sounds. They are produced using a glottalic airstream, made by keeping the vocal folds tightly together until after the stop is released. These sounds only occur syllable initially.
		</p>
		<p>Note that the apostrophe by itself represents a glottal stop, a distinct consonant which is not an ejective. When it is necessary to differentiate in the practical orthography between an ejective and a sequence of consonant plus glottal stop, a hyphen is employed. Thus, &lt;neek'eh&gt; 'our tracks', with an ejective &lt;k'&gt;, versus &lt;nek-'e&#808;h&gt; 'I see it' , with a sequence &lt;k&gt; plus glottal stop &lt;'&gt;.
