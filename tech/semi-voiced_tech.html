<h1>Technical Notes -- Semi-voiced Fricatives </h1>
<p>Tanacross contains five consonants which are represented in the practical orthography with an underscore: &lt;<u>&#322;</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>th</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>s</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>sh</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>x</u>&gt;. These consonants have been described as <span class="def"> semi-voiced</span> or partially voiced fricatives. They can be informally described as beginning voiceless and transitioning to a voiced sound. 
<p>The voicing transition can be seen quite clearly in the following spectrogram.  Voice bars are not present at the beginning of the lateral fricative &lt;<u>&#322;</u>&gt;, but they are present at the end. </p>

&lt;sh<u>&#322;</u>ig'&gt; &nbsp;'my dog'</p>
<p>For other segments the voicing transition is not quite so evident. For example, compare the voiceless dental fricative &lt;th&gt; in the following spectrogram,</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/stand(1s).gif" width="400" height="160"><br>
&lt;na'ihthet&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am standing'</p>
<p>with the semi-voiced fricative in the spectrogram below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/stand(3s).gif" width="400" height="160"><br>
&lt;na'e<u>th</u>et&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;'s/he is standing'</p>
<p>No clear evidence of voicing is present in either spectrogram. The distinguishing feature is the presence of a much greater degree of high-amplitude noise in the voiceless segment. It is this observation which leads to the characterization of the voiceless segments as <span class="def">fortis</span>, and the semi-voiced and voiced fricatives as <span class="def">lenis</span>. </p>
