<h2>palatal fricatives </h2>
<p>Tanacross &lt;sh&gt;  is a voiceless palatal fricative  [&#x283;]. This sound occurs most commonly in the morpheme representing the first person singular subject in certain verb conjugations. For example, &lt;ishn&#261;&#261;&gt; 'I am drinking it'. Elsewhere this is a fairly rare sound in Tanacross, occurring for example in a few nouns such as &lt;sh&eacute;t&gt; 'wart'.	
<p>Letter &lt;<u>sh</u>&gt; is a <span class="def"><a href="semi-voiced_tech.html">semi-voiced</a></span> fricative. It can generally be described as beginning voiceless and transitioning to a fully voiced fricative. 
<p>There is no fully voiced palatal fricative in Tanacross. Where neighboring Athabascan languages exhibit a voiced palatal fricative, Tanacross has a semi-voiced palatal fricative (in stem-initial position) or a voiced palatal approximant (elsewhere).
