# The Tanacross Language

## The Name Tanacross

style="float:right;margin-left:10px;">
Tanacross is the ancestral language of the Mansfield-Ketchumstuk and Healy Lake-Joseph Village bands of Athabascan people, whose ancestral territory encompassed an area bounded by the Goodpaster River to the west, the Alaska Range to the south, the Fortymile and Tok Rivers to the east, and the Yukon Uplands to the north.

The word Tanacross has been used to refer both to a village in eastern Alaska and to the language spoken there. A more appropriate term may be **Dihthâad Xt'een Iin Aanděeg'**, literally <i>The Mansfield People's Language</i>, referring to the traditional village of Dihthâad (<i>Mansfield</i>), north of Tanacross. The modern village of Tanacross is accessible by a short access road from the Alaska Highway, and some speakers now reside in the regional center of Tok, located approximately ten miles east of the village on the highway. In addition several speakers now reside in the nearest commercial center of Fairbanks, located two hundred miles downstream from Tanacross village and accessible by all-weather highway. 

## Relationship to Other  Languages  

Tanacross is one of a group of closely related languages which together comprise the Athabascan family. Tanacross is one of eleven Athabascan languages spoken in Alaska; another two dozen or so Athabascan languages are spoken outside Alaska. Athabascan is a language family in the same sense that the European languages form a family. That is, just as English, German, French, Spanish, Russian, etc. belong to the European family, so the various Athabascan languages of Alaska, Canada, the Pacific Coast and the Southwestern United States belong to the Athabascan family. Outside Alaska, Athabascan languages are often referred to as Dene, derived from the word for 'person' (in Tanacross the word is <i>dendeh</i>); however, the term Dene is not widely used in Alaska. 


## Language Structure

Athabascan languages differ in several ways from the European languages. One notable difference is the Sound System, which is exemplified in this CD. Another prominent difference is the structure of words. It is often noted that Athabascan may correspond to an entire sentence in English. For example, consider the Tanacross word <i>tâatihdaał</i> 'I'll go back home'. This word is actually composed of at least seven individual parts:

tá-  | na-  | t-   | ih-  | d-   | haa | -ł
-----|------|------|------|------|-----|---
home | back | future | I  | back | walk| future


<table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="9" cellspacing="2">
<tr>
<td>tá-</td>
<td>na-</td>
<td>t-</td>
<td>ih-</td>
<td>d-</td>
<td>haa</td>
<td>ł</td>
</tr>
<tr class="gloss">
<td>home</td>
<td>back</td>
<td>future</td>
<td>I</td>
<td>back</td>
<td>go </td>
<td>future</td>
</tr>
</table>

These various bits of the word combine in a regular way to form the actual word tâatihdaał. Of course, not every Tanacross word is this complicated. But one common feature of Athabascan languages is that the verb word contains information about who is doing the action: I, you, she/he, etc. For example,

<table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="9" cellspacing="2">
<tr>
<td class="tnc">ghihhaał</td>
<td class="gloss">I am walking </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tnc">ghinhaał</td>
<td class="gloss">you are walking </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tnc">aahaał</td>
<td class="gloss">she or he is walking </td>
</tr>
</table>

While it is possible to form the equivalent of an entire English sentence with one Tanacross word, many Tanacross sentences do contain more than one word. Learners will notice that the order of words in Tanacross sentences is different than that in English.

<table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="9" cellspacing="3">
<tr>
<td class="tnc">teltsêdz</td>
<td class="tnc">nek-'ęh</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mouse</td>
<td>I see </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" class="gloss">I see a mouse</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Meaning

Another area in which Tanacross  differs substantially from languages like English is in the area of meaning. Learners often seek the answer to the question: &quot;How do I say X in Tanacross?&quot; In some cases this question is not so easy to answer. The problem is that there is not a one-to-one equivalence between Tanacross words and English words. For example, Tanacross has different words to refer to <span class="gloss">one person walking</span>, <span class="gloss">more than one person walking</span>, and <span class="gloss">animals walking</span>. Note the difference in the end of each Tanacross word below. 

<table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="9" cellspacing="2">
<tr>
<td>aa**haał**</td>
<td class="gloss">he is walking along</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>xaa<b>d&eacute;ł</b></td>
<td class="gloss">they are walking along</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ah<b>'és</b></td>
<td class="gloss">(animals) are walking along</td>
</tr>
</table>

So, the answer to the question: &quot;How do I say 'walk' in Tanacross?&quot; is: &quot;it depends&quot;. Similarly, Tanacross uses different words for referring to objects being in position or handling objects, depending on the nature of the object. For example,

<table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="9" cellspacing="2">
<tr>
<td> ee'&#261;&#261; </td>
<td class="gloss">a single compact object (such as rock) is lying there </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> eek&#261;&#261;  </td>
<td class="gloss">liquid (in a container) is lying there </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eet&#261;&#261; </td>
<td class="gloss">a single elongated object (such as stick) is lying there </td>
</tr>
</table>

## Sounds
