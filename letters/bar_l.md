layout: letter
letter: barl 
display: Ł (barred-L) 
description: "Letter <b>ł</b> is called <span class='def'>barred l</span> or <span class='def'>Indian l</span>, and is made with the tongue in the same place as the plain  l. Like plain l, air moves out of the mouth by going around the sides of the tongue. Unlike l, the sound <b>ł</b> is voiceless and is made with friction, so it sounds a bit rough."
