display: "' (glottal stop)" 
description: The <span class="def">glottal stop</span> is wrtten with an apostrphe ( <b>&#8217; )</b>. It is a distinct sound from the ejective sound which is also written with an apostrophe. It is pronounced as a slight "catch in the breath". It is called a "glottal stop" because the vocal cords are held tightly together, stopping air from moving from the lungs and into the mouth.  This is the same sound which occurs in the middle of the English expression 'uh-oh' (although it is not written with an apostrophe in English).

{: .warning }
Note  that when a word begins with a glottal stop the apostrophe is not written. Thus, words which are written with an initial vowel are pronounced with an initial glottal stop.



It is important to distinguish between the presence and absence of glottal stop  at the end of words. Click below to hear Mrs.&nbsp;Irene Arnold and Mrs.&nbsp;Laura Sanford pronouncing words illustrating the contrast in words ending with and without glottal stop.
