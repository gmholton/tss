# About the project

The audio and video clips assembled here are intended to illustrate the sounds and sound combinations of the Tanacross language. We hope that this will help people learn to speak Tanacross. Just as no two speakers of English have exactly the same pronunciation, so it is that no two speakers of Tanacross pronounce all words in exactly the same way. Even a single speaker may pronounce words differently according to context or occasion. The recordings found here represent a brief snapshot of speech and are intended only to serve as a guide to pronunciation. 

The English translations for each Tanacross word are meant to be representative. Many Tanacross words can be translated with multiple English words. Only one potential translation is provided in the examples.    

## History

The idea for this project grew out of our experience learning Tanacross language in both informal and classroom settings. While it was possible to record speakers and listen to recordings outside of class time, we found the recordings to be a poor substitute for actually watching the speaker's pronunciation in class. Difficult sequences such as &lt;xgh&gt; or &lt;tn&gt; were clearly recognizable in class but difficult to hear on an audio recording. We found video recordings to be a much better alternative. We thus set out to obtain high quality video recordings of careful pronunciations of all of the Tanacross Sounds.


Rick Thoman developed a grant proposal to the Endangered Language Fund as part of a  class entitled *Community Language Documentation* at the University of Alaska Fairbanks in Spring 2003. With this funding he was able to compensate speakers for their time working on the project. The video recording was done by Eric Chaikin, as part of the Tanacross Film Project. Chaikin was supported in part by the National Science Foundation EPSCoR program. Without his dedication and expertise, this project would not have been possible. 

This site includes approximately 60 separate audio clips and 275 different video files. Audio recordings were recorded directly to computer, then compressed to mp3 format. Video recordings were made using a Sony HD-700 high-definition digital video camera. These recordings were transferred to computer and saved as Quicktime format using Sorenson compression. Video files were later converted to mp4 H.265 encoding. While the audio recordings were collected over a period of several years, the video recordings were made during a relatively short period in 2007. 

This site was recoded from the original CD-ROM files in February 2023 by Gary Holton. The new site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and Github Pages. The repository is available on [Github](http://github.com/gmholton/tss).

Funding for this project was provided by the [Endangered Language Fund](http://www.endangeredlanguagefund.org).

## About the authors

Three speakers contributed audio and video recordings for this project: Mrs. Irene Arnold,  Mrs. Laura Sanford, and Mr. Kenny Thomas, Sr. 

- Mrs. Arnold has devoted much of the past two decades to the teaching and documentation of her ancestral language, producing a number of publications, including <i>Tanacross  Language Lessons</i> (1994) and <i>Tanacross Phrase and Conversation Lessons </i>(2003). She is currently Tanacross Language Specialist at the Alaska Native Language Center. 
- Mrs. Sanford is an active contributor to  language revitalization and language documentation programs, participating in the Tanana Chiefs Conference Mentor-Apprentice program and the Tanacross Dictionary Project. 
- Mr. Thomas has participated in a number of language and culture revitalization projects and recently completed (with Craig Mishler) an oral history entitled <i>Crow is My Boss </i>(2005).
- Mr. Eric Chaikin is an M.F.A. candidate at the University of Montana. His M.F.A. project, <i>K'a nech'oxdekdiigh -- I'm not going to teach you,</i> is an experiential film which tells the story of the Tanacross language and its role in the community. 
- Mr. Rick Thoman received his M.A. in Linguistics and Alaska Native Languages from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2004 for his work on the *Tanacross Learner's Dictionary*. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
- Dr. Gary Holton is Associate Professor of Linguistics at the Alaska Native Language Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks, where he pursues work related to the documentation and revitalization of Alaska Athabascan languages.
