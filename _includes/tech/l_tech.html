Tanacross <b>&#322;</b>  is a voiceless <span class="def">lateral fricative</span> [&#x26C;], and <b>l</b> is a voiced lateral approximant [l]. While <b>l</b> is phonetically an approximant, it patterns phonologically as the voiced counterpart to the voiceless lateral fricative, participating in all relevant phonological voicing alternations which apply to other fricatives. Neighboring languages, such as Han, exhibit a voiced lateral fricative corresponding to the Tanacross <b>l</b>
