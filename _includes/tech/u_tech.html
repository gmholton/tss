Short <b>u</b> and long <b>uu</b> both represent a <span class="def">high back vowel</span> [u]. When it occurs between velar consonants, the phoneme /u/ may be lowered to [o], in which case it is generally written <b>o</b> rather than <b>u</b>. Thus, note the difference in the pre-stem vowel in the following examples. <br/><br/>
<span class="tnc">naxghogdeg</span> 'I should tell a story' <br/>
<span class="tnc">naxghuldeg</span> 'you should tell a story' <br/>
