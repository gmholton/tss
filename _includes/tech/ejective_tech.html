Tanacross contains six consonants which are written with an apostrophe in the practical orthography: <b>tth'</b>, <b>t'</b>, <b>ts'</b>, <b>tl'</b>, <b>ch'</b>, <b>k'</b>. These are the so-called <span class="def">glottalized</span> or <span class="def">ejective</span> sounds. They are produced using a glottalic airstream, made by keeping the vocal folds tightly together until after the stop is released. These sounds only occur syllable initially.
<br/><br/>
Note that the apostrophe by itself represents a glottal stop, a distinct consonant which is not an ejective. When it is necessary to differentiate in the practical orthography between an ejective and a sequence of consonant plus glottal stop, a hyphen is employed. Thus, <b>neek'eh</b> 'our tracks', with an ejective <b>k'</b>, versus <b>nek-'e&#808;h</b> 'I see it' , with a sequence <b>k</b> plus glottal stop <b>'</b>.
