Tanacross <b>yh</b> is a voiceless <span class="def">palatal approximant</span> (sonorant) [&#xE7;]. While it may sometimes be produced with slight friction, it patterns phonologically as an approximant, not a fricative. It is restricted to syllable-final position. Tanacross <b>y</b> is a voiced palatal approximant [j]. It may occur in both onset and coda positions. The contrast between <b>yh</b> and its voiced counterpart <b>y</b> can be seen in pairs <b>xeyh</b> 'spruce roots' versus <b>xey</b> 'winter'.
<br/><br/>
At the end of a syllable <b>y</b> may occur lengthened, written <b>yy</b>, as in <b>sh'&#x1CE;ayy'</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'my snowshoes'.
